            <em>"In common understanding, '1 2 3 4 5' is not as random as '3 5 2 1 4' and certainly not as random as '47 88 1 32 41' 
            but we can't say authoritatively that the first sequence is not random ... it could have been generated by chance."<p class="text-end"> -Jonathan Knudson</p></em>
            
            <p>I find groups of random numbers fascinating. When drawn thousands or millions of times, will patterns appear? Will some numbers 
            dominate while others appear less frequently? Do certain numbers appear together? With enough data, can we predict future outcomes?

            <p>This website is intended to be a fun investigation into random numbers. It only scratches the surface of random number analytics and their use 
            in lottery games. This app employs the Python PRNG to randomly select numbers from a list associated with a particular game. 
            The number is then removed from the list to simulate the number ball being removed from the lottery machine.<span id="less"> Below is a quick history

            <p>Randomness finds application in art, music, science, cryptography and especially games. This led to the development of several different methods 
            for generating random data. Some of these have existed since ancient times including classic examples like
            the rolling of dice, coin flipping, the shuffling of playing cards, the use of yarrow stalks (for divination) in the I Ching, as well as 
            countless other techniques. Because of the mechanical nature of these techniques, generating large quantities of 
            sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required much work and time.<sup>1</sup></span></p>

            <p>The first recorded signs of a lottery are keno slips from the Chinese Han dynasty between 205 and 187 BC. These lotteries 
            are believed to have helped to finance major government projects like the Great Wall of China. From the Chinese Book of Songs 
            (2nd millennium BC.) comes a reference to a game of chance as "the drawing of wood", which in context appears to describe the drawing of lots.
            The earliest records of a lottery offering tickets for sale is the lottery organized by Roman Emperor Augustus. The funds were for repairs in the 
            City of Rome, and the winners were given prizes in the form of articles of unequal value.<sup>2</sup></p>

            <p>Today, governments around the world run a plethora of legal lotteries that reward the few lucky winners and (hopefully) support local programs.
            In Oregon, the lottery supports State Parks, Natural Habitats, Economic Growth, Outdoor School, Public Schools and Veteran Services.<sup>3</sup></p>
